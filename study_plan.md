_This template was created by ChatGPT using the prompt:_

  > hi! I am in a data analytics class and need to carve out 10 hours a week to study. Can you help me create a study plan - I study best in the evenings after my kids go to bed at 10pm. I can commit to one after after bedtime and maybe one hour in the morning before they get up from 7am - 8am. I can do this study plan on the weekdays and I can put in some extra time on Sunday mornings between 9am and 12pm. Can you put the plan into markdown?
