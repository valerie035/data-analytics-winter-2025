# Module 7: Choose Your Adventure 

This week is "Choose Your Adventure" week where you go deeper on a topic of your choice - this could be AI using Lovable.dev, Data Visualization, SQL, BI tooling (see the PowerBI file in this folder), Excel or Google Sheets, or even trying your hand at Python or R if you are interested! Using our class format  - find a series of video lessons and watch and complete them. Then choose a data set and analyze it in your prefered tool, leveraging the video lesson you watched to complete the assignment. OR build an app using lovable.dev. Goal = Spend 10 hours on the topic of your choice. 

# Video Lessons: 

- [ ] Curate the videos you watched for your topic of choice and add here under "Video Lessons".
- [ ] Ideas for videos could be Alex the Analyst videos on advanced excel topics, intermidiate SQL, or intro to Python from his [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSNXoAs2FtQ) series.

# Assignment: 

- [ ] Add your completed project to [this discussion](https://github.com/Tech-Moms/data-analytics-winter-2025/discussions/197).
