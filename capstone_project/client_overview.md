# Capstone Project Outline for Data Analytics Service

**Overview:**  
We are seeking potential partners for our students' data analytics capstone project. This is a unique opportunity for your business to receive high-quality data analysis services while helping to train the next generation of data analysts. Our students are part of [Tech Moms](https://www.tech-moms.org/), a non-profit focused on upskilling women, particularly mothers, in technical fields. In our data analytics program students learn tools like Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and other business intelligence platforms, and they are eager to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges.

**Purpose of the Capstone Project:**  
The capstone project is designed as a hands-on experience for our students to apply their technical and analytical skills to real-world business data. This project will benefit your organization by providing insights and actionable recommendations based on your data.

**Project Scope:**  
We are looking for projects where our students can:

- Analyze a specific dataset that your business has available (e.g., sales data, customer feedback, website traffic, etc.).
- Provide insights on trends, patterns, or areas for improvement based on the data.
- Build visualizations or dashboards to clearly present the findings and help inform decision-making.
- Develop reports summarizing their key findings and actionable recommendations.

**Examples of Project Types:**

- **Sales Performance Analysis:** Identify key sales trends, best-selling products/services, and areas where growth can be improved.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Analyze customer data to segment based on demographics, behaviors, or purchasing patterns.
- **Marketing Campaign Effectiveness:** Assess the impact of marketing campaigns and provide insights on ROI or audience engagement.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Examine internal processes to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies based on operational data.
- **Annual Report Preparation:** Assist in preparing data visualizations and summaries for annual reports or board presentations.

**Deliverables:**  
At the end of the project, your organization will receive:

1. **Data Analysis Summary Report** – A detailed document outlining the analysis, methodology, and key insights.
2. **Data Visualizations/Dashboard** – Interactive or static dashboard to visualize the findings and communicate them clearly to stakeholders.
3. **Presentation of Results** – Students will present their findings to your team, with an opportunity for feedback and refinement.

**Timeline:**  
The project will span two - three weeks, and students will dedicate their time to analyzing your data and developing deliverables. After an initial project kickoff, regular check-ins will ensure that the project stays on track and meets your expectations.

**Our Only Ask:**  
If the student provides you with valuable service through this project, we kindly ask that you offer the student a recommendation on LinkedIn to recognize their contributions.
