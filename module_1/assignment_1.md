# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

#### **1. Response:**
  
The role of AI tools in learning Data Analytics is large in size and deep in complexity. Since I am still fairly new to tech language in general, I lean on the use of AI and other search engines to help in my learning process. My expectations for how ChatGPT can help me are fair, comparatively. I have developed a method for my learning journey over the past **2 decades** that utilizes Google, YouTube, and now ChatGPT. I can figure just about anything out. What I have learned is that even with the use of these great tools, sometimes consulting with a person is more beneficial for the moments when you get stuck. With the human brain being as complex as it is, we do require multiple avenues to get to a desired lot of information.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
  ChatGPT’s response to this prompt was straightforward and thorough. I immediately went to my own tables to test the responses, and it *worked.*

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
#### **3. Comparison**
 Google’s response is comparable. It gave a straightforward answer along with resources and websites where this question is answered. Google offers other resources such as videos, blogs, or other websites with information to dig through to find an answer. Since this was a straightforward answer, I did not feel I needed more information to dive into.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
  
 I asked both Chat and Google about data visualization, I wanted an image, or visual aids to give me an example of what I am trying to make. In this case, Google was the better option because it gave me images immediately, while Chat gave a list of how-to’s. Though both are helpful, it was the images that I wanted.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information
  
It would be appropriate to use Chat when you need a quick how-to, or wanting a specific, to the point response. Chat is also good for leading to new searches by asking follow up questions from the previous response. I call this *“going down the rabbit hole”* or *“following the breadcrumbs.”* Google would be more appropriate for visual aids, research into a deeper understanding from a more academic standpoint. Now, there are instances when I want to verify, or cross reference something so I use both to see if they give generally the same thing. If I get two very different responses, then I do a deep dive and research in order to have accuracy.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  
####  **Final Reflection**

When it comes to using **ChatGPT** or **Google**, I decide which I want to use based on what *type* of response I am looking for. Sometimes the resources from Google are helpful when I want to research a topic and know the why/how behind the answer from many different resources. If I want a direct, straight to the point answer, I go to Chat.
